## Tell Me a Little Bit About Yourself :sunglasses:

I am a fullstack web developer. I also do some data science. I specialize in creating accessible fullstack applications.

My strength is my ability to create accessible websites. I pride myself on my reputation in the community by creating responsive and accessible web applications. Not only that, every time I have done creating the website, I spare my time to write `README` to explain the process of how I created the website.

**I recommend looking through my github repositories which showcase my current skills.**

Other than directly coding, I also spend my time doing other things. My interests outside the coding world mainly lie in mathematics-based fields such as maths(obviouslyðŸ˜…), electronics, and physics, especially the [quantum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics) part of it.:wink:

## Technical Skills & Tools

- [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/html) - The building block of the web. No website can survive without this.
- [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/css) - The styling language for the web.
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) - Track the history of my projects. It allows me to break things with no worries.
- [Python](https://www.python.org/) - Programming language I use for web development and data science
- [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) - Design tool. I use Figma when I am working with a design file. Of course, I am not a designer.
- [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/javascript) - Programming language for the web browsers.
- [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) - High-level Python web framework for fullstack applications.
- [Powershell](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/) - I use this to work with Git and to install NPM packages.
- [Replit](https://replit.com) - I use this to code with other devs and test a lot of [fun projects](http://replit.com/@OlayinkaHeritag) on my mind. It really lifts a lot of burden off my shoulders because I don't have to install packages on my local device anymore.
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - Code editor. I love this tool. It has almost everything that I need to write code.

## Latest work 

- [Turntable interface for music](https://turntable-interface-for-music.olayinkaheritag.repl.co/). The code is [here](https://replit.com/@OlayinkaHeritag/turntable-interface-for-music/)

## How about Some Bullet Points? :heavy_check_mark:

- I'm currently working on an app that helps college students manage their eating habits. It'll help them eat responsibly and healthily.
- I'm currently learning [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Node js](https://nodejs.org/).
- You can [contact me through email](mailto:tijesuolayinka@gmail.com)
- **Feel free to connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/heritage-olayinka/) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/xpertHeritage)**
- Fun fact: I've also been learning p5.js on the side
